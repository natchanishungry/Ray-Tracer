For the remaining marks, I implemented:

Mirror reflection (0.5 mark)

Fresnel Reflection (0.5 mark)

Refraction (0.5 mark)

Motion blur (0.5-1 mark)

Soft Shadows (1 mark)

Perlin Noise (1 mark)


Final Scene:

In my final scene I have implemented motion blur of spheres, giving them a "velocity". 
My perlin noise is the big eye thing at the top. To implement it I only accepted intersecting rays with noise above a certain threshold. 
My sphere is a perfect reflector, and the boxes beside use fresnel and refraction. 
As you can see as well, soft shadows are implemented for all shapes (including the perlin noise, which has a leopard print kind of shadow).
My perlinnoise.xml also has an interesting shape computed with perlin noise. 

Feel free to look in the file named "PHOTOS" for the pngs.
